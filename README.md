This prject presents the basic of html being used as a recipe webpage. You'll see the basics tags, such as <ul>, <ol>, <p>, etc.

I'm very happy with what I've done in this page (although basic), it has been a blast of learning all the different tags and actually putting them to work. I'm actually doing this course with two other people and it feels good doing this with friends so that you can help each other. 

This is all; Deivv.
