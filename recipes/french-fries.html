    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><em>French fries</em> (North American English), <em>chips</em> (British English), <em>finger chips</em> (Indian English), French-fried potatoes, or simply fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating from either Belgium or
        France. They are prepared by cutting the potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually in a deep fryer. Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes.</p>

    <p>French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are often salted and may
        be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialties. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine or chili cheese fries. Chips can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant,
        oven chips, uses less or no oil.</p>
