    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The lemon pie or tart has a colourful history but historians are not in agreement about its origins. The basic preparation seems to have been invented when someone decided to fill a pastry base with lemon flavoured custard. Even this is the basis
        for most lemon pies and tarts, wherever they are made.</p>

    <p>The lemon custard is usually made of eggs, sugar, lemon juice and sometimes butter or cream and baked in a pastry base. From medieval times in Europe, it was a widely-prepared dessert. Eggs and milk were relatively cheap and found everywhere and,
        from the 12th century onwards, sugar was also available.</p>
